## 💡 Inspiration

Authors being independent and a free bird needs what they deserve and thus remove the third party big corporation that takes their money and their work away from them. We want to help individual authors and as well as the readers to only pay as they read; :)

## 💻 What it does
DBinder aims to eliminate the middle man i.e. the publishers or any other online book services. These publishers have a complete control on the economy of the book market, they can regulate the stuff that authors write and they also take up a huge percentage of the profit. So we have basically created a decentralized marketplace for authors to list their work. And the best part about this is that the users pay only for the number of pages they read. This creates an awesome loop for both, the authors and the users, such that, the users are more willing to try out many more books than they usually would, because they only have to pay what they've read, and since there are more users per book, the authors get more readers than they usually would, and hence, more value.
